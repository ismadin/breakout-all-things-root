Hello all! Here it is the easiest root and recovery method out there!!

**What is this?**
This is a port of the CWM recovery for the Pantech Breakout, root.zip, and unroot.zip. I have grouped it all in together to make it as simple as possible. This can root, unroot, install stock recovery, and install CWM recovery.

**How do I install this?**

**CWM or Stock Recovery**

1.) Download the .zip (http://code.google.com/p/breakout-all-things-root/downloads/detail?name=BreakoutAllinOnePkg.zip)

2.) Extract zip to desktop

3.) Make sure all drivers are installed (Fastboot drivers are included)

4.) On phone, enable USB Debugging

5.) Connect phone to computer and enable USB Mass Storage

6.) Run RecoveryAIO.bat

7.) Make your selection (1-CWM & 2-Stock)

8.) Watch the magic!!!

**Root**

1.) Download the BreakoutRoot.zip, place it on your sdcard. (http://code.google.com/p/breakout-all-things-root/downloads/detail?name=BreakoutRoot.zip)

2.) After CWM installs pull battery

3.) Immediately hold Search & Power through Pantech splash screen (If the phone boots, you will lose recovery and have to start the process all over again.)

4.) Flash BreakoutRoot.zip

5.) Reboot

**Unroot**

1.) Reboot into recovery

2.) Flash BreakoutUnroot.zip http://code.google.com/p/breakout-all-things-root/downloads/detail?name=BreakoutUnRoot.zip

3.) Reboot

4.) Run RecoveryAIO.bat


**Buttons**

The button layout for CWM is volume rocker for up and down, camera button selects, and back button goes back
